# BackroomsAPI
A new, powerful, and accurate API that will give *YOU* the ability to create your own Backrooms levels, entities, and in the future, a lot more!

# Currently...
The api is in progress. I'm doing this project on my own, help will be appreciated. Even though I'm reaching the most busy time of my school year, I'll make sure to spend time on that project and progress.

# To Do:
- [x] Make a backrooms entity creator (using CitizensAPI)
- [x] Make a loot generator using containers
- [x] Finish the Entity Registry and management class
- [x] Store the entity's information
- [ ] Make a level creator
- [ ] Make a level Registry and management class
- [ ] Spawning the entities naturally
- [ ] Make a loot rarity system
- [ ] Create a wiki (Final step before publishing)
